# genexit
Simple GUI shutdown menu for tiling WMs in Python inspired by [cb-exit](https://github.com/super-nathan/cb-exit).

# How to Use
This is a **linux only** script that uses **python 2**

You should be able to run this by using the python interpreter, or by chmodding it and sticking it in your bin folder so you can run it easily from the commandline.

This menu has four options: cancel, logoff, reboot, and shutdown. More buttons can be added, removed, and moved around easily.
